<h1><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Development and Production profiles</h1>

<p>
JHipster comes with two "profiles":
</p>

<ul>
  <li>"dev" for development: it focuses on ease of development and productivity</li>
  <li>"prod" for production: it focuses on performance and scalability</li>
 </ul>

<p>
Those profiles come in two different configurations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Maven profiles are used at build time. For example <code>mvn -Pprod package</code> will package a production application.</li>
  <li>The Spring profiles work a run time. Some Spring beans will behave differently, depending on the profile.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Spring profiles are set by Maven, so we have a consistancy between the two methods: of course, you should have a "prod" profile on Maven and Spring at the same time.
</p>

<p>
To put it simply, if you run JHipster in default mode, you will use the "dev" profile:
</p>
<p>
<code>
mvn tomcat7:run
</code>
</p>
<p>
And if you want to run JHipster with the "prod" profile, use:
</p>
<p>
<code>
mvn -Pprod tomcat7:run
</code>
</p>
