<h1><i class="fa fa-bolt"></i> Creating an entity</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Once you have created your application, you will want to create <i>entities</i>. For example, you might want to create the <i>book</i> entity, which represents a book. For this, you will need:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A database table</li>
 <li>A JPA Entity</li>
 <li>A Spring Data JPA Repository</li>
 <li>A Spring MVC REST Controller, which has the basic CRUD operations</li>
 <li>An AngularJS router, a controller and a service</li>
 <li>An HTML view</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you created your application with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> instead of a more classical SQL/JPA solution, JHipster will still generate your entity correctly (you will have a MongoDB document instead of a JPA entity).
</p>
<p>
The "entity" sub-generator will help you to create most of this code, but it isn't magical, so you will need customize some of the generated code.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Let's create the "Foo" entity, which has a text field and a date field.</b>
</p>

<h2>Generate the entity</h2>
<p>Create the entity with the sub-generator. For instance, for creating the "Foo" entity, please type:
</p>
<p>
<code>
yo jhipster:entity foo
</code>
</p>
<p>
  If you have followed our <a href="{{ site.url }}/development.html">development guide</a> and have your application running with "hot reload", everything should just work out of the box: your running application should be updated, as well as your database and even your browser. Just go to <a href="http://localhost:9000/#/foo" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000/#/foo</a> to use the generated default CRUD page.	
</p>
<p>
  If you didn't use hot reload, you will have a little more work to do (see the next part on Liquibase for more information), and of course you will need to restart your application to see your changes.
</p>

<h2>Check the database table</h2>

<p>
  JHipster uses <a href="http://www.liquibase.org" target="_blank">Liquibase</a> to update its database schema. The Liquibase configuration is located in the <code>src/main/resources/config/liquibase</code> folder.
<p>
  If you have used hot reload in the previous step, JHipster has automatically created a new file named <code>src/main/resources/config/liquibase/changelog/db-changelog--002.xml</code>.
</p>
<p>
	If you didn't use hot reload, you have to create this file yourself (that's why we recommend using hot reload):
<ul>
  <li>Add a new Liquibase configuration file called <code>src/main/resources/config/liquibase/changelog/db-changelog--002.xml</code></li>
  <li>Add a new "changeSet" XML node (and don't forget to increment its version!)</li>
  <li>Describe this new "changeSet": you can look at the existing "changeSet", or go to the
  <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/index.html" target="_blank">Liquibase documentation</a> for more information</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Customize the generated JPA code</h2>
<p>
  The generated entity has:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>An auto-generated ID</li>
  <li>A sample text field called "sampleTextAttribute"</li>
  <li>A sample date field called "sampleDateAttribute"</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Of course, you will have to customize those fields for your specific entities.
</p>
<h2>Review the generated Java code</h2>
<p>
  JHipster has created a Spring Data JPA repository called <code>FooRepository</code> and a Spring MVC REST Controller called <code>FooResource</code>.
</p>
<p>
Those files contain all the basic CRUD operations, and don't need to be modified if your needs are simple.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you want some more complex business behaviors, you might need to add a Spring <code>@Service</code> class, using the <a href="{{ site.url }}/creating_a_service.html">service sub-generator</a>.
</p>

<h2>Review the generated JavaScript files</h2>
<p>
  JHipster has created three JavaScript files for you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>An AngularJS router called <code>src/main/webapp/scripts/foo/router.js</code></li>
  <li>An AngularJS controller called <code>src/main/webapp/scripts/foo/controller.js</code></li>
  <li>An AngularJS service called <code>src/main/webapp/scripts/foo/service.js</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Those files have been automatically added to your <code>index.html</code> file, just after the other existing AngularJS scripts.
</p>

<h2>Customize the generated HTML view</h2>
<p>
  JHipster has created a <code>foos.html</code> view, which has the basic CRUD operations.
</p>
<p>
  This view will be where most of the work will occur, depending on the attributes you have added to your entity, and your business requirements.
</p>

<h2>You're done!</h2>
<p>
  You can test your "foo" controller on <a href="http://localhost:8080/#/foo" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/#/foo</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It should look like this:
