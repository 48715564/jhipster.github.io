<h1><i class="fa fa-bolt"></i> Creating an entity</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Once you have created your application, you will want to create <i>entities</i>. For example, you might want to create the <i>Book</i> entity, which represents a book. For this, you will need:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A database table</li>
 <li>A Liquibase change set</li>
 <li>A JPA Entity</li>
 <li>A Spring Data JPA Repository</li>
 <li>A Spring MVC REST Controller, which has the basic CRUD operations</li>
 <li>An AngularJS router, a controller and a service</li>
 <li>An HTML view</li>
</ul>
<p>
The "entity" sub-generator will create all the necessary files, and provide a CRUD front-end to the entity.
</p>
<p>
If you created your application with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> instead of a more classical SQL/JPA solution, JHipster will still generate your entity correctly (you will have a MongoDB document instead of a JPA entity).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Let's create the "Book" entity, which has a title, description, publication date, and price.</b>
</p>

<h2>Generate the entity</h2>
<p>Create the entity with the sub-generator. For instance, for creating the "Book" entity, please type:
</p>
<p>
<code>
yo jhipster:entity book
</code>
</p>
<p>
    You must answer the next questions, asking for each field name and type. For example, the "Book" has:
    <ul>
        <li>a "title", of type "String"</li>
        <li>a "description", of type "String"</li>
        <li>a "publicationDate", of type "LocalDate"</li>
        <li>a "price", of type "Integer"</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    This will generate all the required files.
</p>

<h2>Check the generated CRUD front-end</h2>

<p>
    Run the generated test suite, with <code>mvn test</code>, which will test the new Book entity.
</p>
<p>
    Launch the application (for example with <code>mvn spring-boot:run</code>), log in and select the "Book"
    entity in the "entities" menu.
</p>
<p>
    Check the database table, to see if your data is correctly inserted.
</p>

<h2>Improve the generated code</h2>
<p>
    The generated files contain all the basic CRUD operations, and don't need to be modified if your needs are simple.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to modify the generated code or the database schema, you should follow our <a href="{{ site.url }}/development.html">development guide</a>
</p>
<p>
If you want some more complex business behaviors, you might need to add a Spring <code>@Service</code> class, using the <a href="{{ site.url }}/creating_a_service.html">service sub-generator</a>.
</p>

<h2>You're done!</h2>

<p>
  Your generated CRUD page should look like this:
