# <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Error: constraint violation

Welcome to the [JHipster]({{ site.url }}) website!

You probably found this page by clicking on an error message in an application that was developed with JHipster.

## Error description

This is a generic JHipster error, that is displayed when there is a validation error, typically using [Bean Validation](http://beanvalidation.org/). The error message should tell you which constraint failed, and for which reason.

## How can this page be customized?

Error pages are configured in each application's `ErrorConstants` class. If you want to provide your own error pages in your application, please modify this class accordingly.
