# <i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Using fisherman

If you are using Linux or Mac OS X, [fisherman](http://fisherman.sh/) is a great tool to manage your [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) configuration.

Some of the JHipster development team user fisherman, and if you see people using shortcuts in their terminal, the magic comes from here!

## Fisherman JHipster plugin

The JHipster fisherman plugin is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-fisherman-plugin](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-fisherman-plugin).

Currently it only adds shortcuts (full list [here](https://github.com/atomfrede/jhipster-fisherman-plugin/blob/master/conf.d/jhipster.aliases.fish)), but we welcome contributions to have better auto-completion!

It is not part (yet) of the official plugin list, so you need to install it manually:

1. Clone the plugin repository:

    `git clone git@github.com:atomfrede/jhipster-fisherman-plugin.git`

2. Install it via ``fisher`` command from local directory:

    `fisher ~/path/to/cloned/repository`

For more details about [fisherman](http://fisherman.sh/) have a look at ther [FAQ](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman/#faq)
