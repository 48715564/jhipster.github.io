<p class="lead">
JHipster is a <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman generator</a>,
used to create a <b>Spring Boot + AngularJS</b> project.
</p>

<p>
Our goal is to generate for you a complete and modern Web app, unifying:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A high-performance and robust Java stack on the server side with Spring Boot</li>
    <li>A sleek, modern, mobile-first front-end with AngularJS and Bootstrap</li>
	<li>A powerful workflow to build your application with Yeoman, Bower, Grunt and Maven</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can checkout a sample generated application <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
JHipster is Open Source, and all developement is done on <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster" target="_blank">Github</a></li>
</p>
<ul>
