<h1><i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> Installing JHipster</h1>

<h2>Local installation vs. Docker</h2>

<p>
    We provide 2 ways of working with JHipster:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can do a "local installation", which is the classical way of working with JHipster. Everything is installed
        on your machine, which can be a little complex to set up, but that's how most people usually work. In case of
        doubt, choose this installation.
    </li>
    <li>You can use a "<a href="https://www.docker.io/" target="_blank">Docker</a>" container, which brings you a
        lightweight, virtualized container with everything already installed. You don't have to worry about installing
        everything. But Docker is a rather young tool, and you need to know how to use Linux quite well.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Local installation (recommended for normal users)</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Install Java from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">the
        Oracle website</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Install <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">Maven</a> if you want to use Maven as the build tool.
        If you prefer to use <a href="http://www.gradle.org/" target="_blank">Gradle</a> instead, don't install it, as
        JHipster ships with the <a href="http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html" target="_blank">Gradle
            Wrapper</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Install Git from <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git-scm.com</a>. We recommend you also use a tool
        like <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank">SourceTree</a> if you are starting with Git.
    </li>
    <li>Install Node.js from <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">the Node.js website</a>. This will also
        install <code>npm</code>, which is the node package manager we are using in the next commands.
    </li>
    <li>Install Yeoman: <code>npm install -g yo</code></li>
    <li>Install Bower: <code>npm install -g bower</code></li>
    <li>Depending on your preferences, install either <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a>
        (recommended) with <code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code> or <a href="http://gulpjs.com/"
                                                                       target="_blank">Gulp.js</a> with <code>npm
            install -g gulp</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Install JHipster: <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Docker installation (for advanced users)</h2>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>
    JHipster has a specific <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-docker" target="_blank">jhipster-docker
    project</a>, which provides a <a href="https://www.docker.io/" target="_blank">Docker</a> container.
</p>
<p>
    This project makes a Docker "Trusted build" that is available on:
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jdubois/jhipster-docker/" target="_blank">https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jdubois/jhipster-docker/</a>
</p>
<p>
    This image will allow you to run JHipster inside Docker.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
    Depending on your operating system,
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Linux :</b> Linux supports docker out-of-box. You just need to follow the tutorial on the <a
            href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation" target="_blank">Docker</a> website.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Mac &amp; Windows :</b> <b> <a href="https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox"> Docker Toolbox</a></b> - This is
        an official docker application to speed up Docker use on non-linux platform.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>PLEASE NOTE : </b> If you are using boot2docker, it's good idea to migrate to docker toolbox, you can follow
        steps on how to migrate at <b>FAQ</b> section on <a href="https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox">https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox</a>

        <p>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Usage on Linux/Mac Windows (using docker toolbox)</h3>
<p>
    Pull the JHipster Docker image:
</p>
<p>
    <code>
        docker pull jdubois/jhipster-docker
    </code>
</p>
<p>
    Create a "jhipster" folder in your home directory:
</p>
<p>
    <code>
        mkdir ~/jhipster
    </code>
</p>
<p>
    Run The docker image, with the following options:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>The Docker "/jhipster" folder is shared to the local "~/jhipster" folder</li>
    <li>Forward all ports exposed by docker (8080 for Tomcat, 3000 for BrowserSync from the "grunt serve" task, 3001 for
        the BrowserSync UI)
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    <code>
        docker run --name jhipster -v ~/jhipster:/home/jhipster/app:rw -v ~/.m2:/home/jhipster/.m2:rw -p 8080:8080 -p
        3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -d -t jdubois/jhipster-docker
    </code>
    <b>PLEASE NOTE : </b> If you have already started the container once before, you do not need to run above command,
    you can simply start/stop existing container.
<p>
<ul>
    <li>To stop the container execute :
        <code>
            docker stop jhipster
        </code>
    </li>
    <li>And to start again, execute :
        <code>
            docker start jhipster
        </code>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
Also in case you update the docker image (rebuild or pull from dockerhub), it's better to remove existing container, and run the container all over again.
To do so, first stop the container and then remove it and run again. i.e. :
<br/>
<code>
    <ol>
        <li>docker stop jhipster</li>
        <li>docker rm jhipster</li>
        <li>docker pull jdubois/jhipster-docker</li>
        <li>docker run --name jhipster -v ~/jhipster:/home/jhipster/app:rw -v ~/.m2:/home/jhipster/.m2:rw -p 8080:8080
            -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -d -t jdubois/jhipster-docker
        </li>
    </ol>
</code>
<p>
<p>
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Please note : </b> On linux, you might need to run the docker command as sudo user if your user is not part of
    docker group. It's a good idea to add your user to docker group so that you can run docker commands as non-root
    user. Follow steps on <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/477554">http://askubuntu.com/a/477554</a> to do so.
</p>

<h3>Accessing the container</h3>
<p>
    The easiest way to log into container is executing following command :
</p>
<p>
    <code>
        docker exec -it --user=jhipster &lt;container_name&gt; bash
    </code>
    <br/><br/>
    if you copy-pasted command to run container from above, notice the name being specified as jhipster
    </br/><br/>
    <code>
        docker exec -it --user=jhipster jhipster bash
    </code>
    <br/><br/>
    You will login as "jhipster" user, if in case you need to change as sudo user, password for the user is same as
    username (i.e. jhipster)
</p>
<h3>Your first project</h3>
<p>
    You can then go to the /home/jhipster/app directory in your container, and start building your app inside Docker:
</p>
<p>
    <code>
        cd ~/jhipster<br/>
        yo jhipster
    </code>
</p>

<p>
    Once your application is created, you can run all the normal grunt/bower/maven commands, for example:
</p>
<p>
    <code>
        mvn
    </code>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Congratulations! You've launched your JHipster app inside Docker!</b>
</p>
<p>
    On your host machine, you should be able to :
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Access the running application at http://DOCKER_HOST_IP:8080</li>
    <li>Get all the generated files inside your shared folder</li>
</ul>

<b>PLEASE NOTE :
</b> Based on your OS your DOCKER_HOST_IP will differ. On linux, it will be simply your localhost. For Mac/Windows, you will have to obtain the IP using following command.
<p>
    <code>
        docker-machine ip default
    </code>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    As the generated files are in your shared folder, they will not be deleted if you stop your Docker container.
    However, if you don't want Docker to keep downloading all the Maven and NPM dependencies every time you start the
    container, you should commit its state.
</p>
