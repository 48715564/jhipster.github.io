<h1><i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> Installing JHipster</h1>

<h2>Local installation vs. Docker</h2>

<p>
We provide 2 ways of working with JHipster:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can do a "local installation", which is the classical way of working with JHipster. Everything is installed on your machine, which can be a little complex to set up, but that's how most people usually work. In case of doubt, choose this installation.</li>
  <li>You can use a "<a href="https://www.docker.io/" target="_blank">Docker</a>" container, which brings you a lightweight, virtualized container with everything already installed. You don't have to worry about installing everything. But Docker is a rather young tool, and you need to know how to use Linux quite well.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Local installation (recommended for normal users)</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Install Java from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">the Oracle website</a>.</li>
    <li>Install <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">Maven</a> if you want to use Maven as the build tool. If you prefer to use <a href="http://www.gradle.org/" target="_blank">Gradle</a> instead, don't install it, as JHipster ships with the <a href="http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html" target="_blank">Gradle Wrapper</a>.</li>
    <li>Install Git from <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git-scm.com</a>. We recommend you also use a tool like <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank">SourceTree</a> if you are starting with Git.</li>
    <li>Install Node.js from <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">the Node.js website</a>. This will also install <code>npm</code>, which is the node package manager we are using in the next commands.</li>
    <li>Install Yeoman: <code>npm install -g yo</code></li>
    <li>Install Bower: <code>npm install -g bower</code></li>
    <li>Depending on your preferences, install either <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> (recommended) with <code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code> or <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp.js</a> with <code>npm install -g gulp</code>.</li>
    <li>Install JHipster: <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Docker installation (for advanced users)</h2>

<h3>Information</h3>

<p>
JHipster has a specific <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-docker" target="_blank">jhipster-docker project</a>, which provides a <a href="https://www.docker.io/" target="_blank">Docker</a> container.
</p>
<p>
This project makes a Docker "Trusted build" that is available on:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jdubois/jhipster-docker/" target="_blank">https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jdubois/jhipster-docker/</a>
</p>
<p>
This image will allow you to run JHipster inside Docker.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
Depending on your operating system,
  <ol>
    <li>
    <b>Linux :</b> Linux supports docker out-of-box. You just need to follow the tutorial on the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation" target="_blank">Docker</a> website.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Mac &amp; Windows :</b> <b> <a href="https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox"> Docker Toolbox</a></b> - This is an official docker application to speed up Docker use on non-linux platform.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>PLEASE NOTE : </b> If you are using boot2docker, it's good idea to migrate to docker toolbox, you can follow steps on how to migrate at <b>FAQ</b> section on <a href="https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox">https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox</a>
    <p>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>Usage on Linux/Mac Windows (using docker toolbox)</h3>
<p>
Pull the JHipster Docker image:
</p>
<p>
<code>
docker pull jdubois/jhipster-docker
</code>
</p>
<p>
Create a "jhipster" folder in your home directory:
</p>
<p>
<code>
mkdir ~/jhipster
</code>
</p>
<p>
Run The docker image, with the following options:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Docker "/jhipster" folder is shared to the local "~/jhipster" folder</li>
    <li>Forward all ports exposed by docker (8080 for Tomcat, 3000 for BrowserSync from the "grunt serve" task, 3001 for the BrowserSync UI)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
<code>
docker run --name jhipster -v ~/jhipster:/jhipster -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -t jdubois/jhipster-docker
</code>
<br/><br/>
<b>Please note : </b> On linux, you might need to run the docker command as sudo user if your user is not part of docker group. It's a good idea to add your user to docker group so that you can run docker commands as non-root user. Follow steps on <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/477554">http://askubuntu.com/a/477554</a> to do so.
</p>

<h3>Accessing the container</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to log into container is executing following command :
</p>
<p>
<code>
docker exec -it &lt;container_name&gt; bash
</code>
<br/><br/>
if you copy-pasted command to run container from above, notice the name being specified as jhipster
</br/><br/>
<code>
docker exec -it jhipster bash
</code>
<br/><br/>
You will login as root user, we recommand you use the "jhipster" user as some of the tool used are not meant to be run by the root user.
</p>
<h3>Your first project</h3>
<p>
You can then go to the /jhipster directory in your container, and start building your app inside Docker:
</p>
<p>
<code>
cd /jhipster<br/>
yo jhipster
</code>
</p>
<p>
  If the following exception occurs, you need to change the owner of the /jhipster directory. See next step.
</p>

  </code>
</p>
<p>
You need to fix the jhipster folder to give the "jhipster" user ownership of the directory:
</p>
<p>
  <code>
    docker exec -it jhipster /jhipster
  </code>
</p>

<p>
Once your application is created, you can run all the normal grunt/bower/maven commands, for example:
</p>
<p>
<code>
mvn spring-boot:run
</code>
</p>
<p>
<b>Congratulations! You've launched your JHipster app inside Docker!</b>
</p>
<p>
On your host machine, you should be able to :
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the running application at <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080</a></li>
    <li>Get all the generated files inside your shared folder</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
As the generated files are in your shared folder, they will not be deleted if you stop your Docker container. However, if you don't want Docker to keep downloading all the Maven and NPM dependencies every time you start the container, you should commit its state.
</p>
