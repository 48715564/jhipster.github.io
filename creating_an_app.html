<h1><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> Creating an application</h1>

<p>To generate your application, type:</p>
<p>
<code>
yo jhipster
</code>
</p>
<p>And answer the questions asked by the generator to create an application taylored to your needs.</p>

<p>Once the application is generated, you can launch the Java server within your IDE, by running the Application class at the root of your application's Java package.</p>

<p>As it is a simple "Main" class, it is the easiest and quickest way to run and debug the application.</p>

<p>If you prefer to use Maven, you can also run your application by typing:</p>
<p>
<code>
mvn spring-boot:run
</code>
</p>
<p>The application will be available on <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080</a></p>
